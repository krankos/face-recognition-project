# CNN Face Recognition

This project is done by **Khalil Bessaad** and **Malek Fehri**

The result of our work is in the notebook `ModelCNN.ipynb`. Other notebooks represent the journey we went through.
A **presentation** is also available.

The model is deployed in a FastAPI backend. The backend can be remotely accessible using ngrok.

A frontend is created using SolidJS to consume the APIs developed in the backend. The frontend is deployed and remotely accessible through Netlify.
